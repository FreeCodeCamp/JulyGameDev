						Things like the kinda of things that you'd put at the bottom of an online html and javascript game like instructions and other things like that to describe things like the game and it's controls
					</p>
					<p>
						Some say that the man who write these kinds of descriptions is ancient and not very good at English but not he's just a bit stupid. That's all
					</p>
					<p>
						This is where all the content for below the game will go but this will all most likely be moved at a later date as the game will probably be hid behind a login screen :p
